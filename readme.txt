== Description ==

This plugin enables you to assign tags to groups. The group membership is saved in the native WP table field of $tag->term_group. The plugin comes with a configurable tag cloud where tags are displayed in tabs sorted by groups.

Please find more information [here](http://www.christoph-amthor.de/plugins/tag-groups/ "plugin website").

== Installation ==

1. Find the plugin in the list at the backend and click to install it. Or, upload the ZIP file through the admin backend. Or, upload the unzipped tag-groups folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

The plugin will create a new submenu in the ‘Post’ section where you can edit the tag groups. In order to assign tags to tag groups, you find a new pull-down menu in the tag edit section.

You can access additional help on how to use the shortcode on the plugin's admin page in the ‘Post’ section.
